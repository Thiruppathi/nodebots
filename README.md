# NodeBots - Robots powered by Java Script


That's right... If you have JavaScript experience, you can use your powers to control Hardware.

NodeBots are any kind of Hardware powered by JavaScript and node.js. These **bots** can be LEDs, sensors, servos, drones, robot arms, thermostats or anything else you can imagine with hardware and electronics.

In this talk, I will guide through assembling and programming few projects using Arduino & node.js

The ultimate combination of Arduino, Johnny-Five, node.js & few other hardware lets you create amazing things. Come tinker with hardware and few lines of JavaScript code to make things light up.


Get an Arduino Starter Kit, if you like to hack after the talk or use it for next month Dev Challenge; Suitable Kits can be found at [oomlout](http://oomlout.co.uk/collections/arduino/products/arduino-starter-kit-ardx) and [Proto-Pic](http://proto-pic.co.uk/proto-pic-arduino-starter-kit-for-arduino-uno/). These kits contain an Arduino, Breadboard, Selection of LEDs, Sensors, Motors, etc.,
