{"name":"Nodebots","tagline":"Control Hardware using node-js","body":"# NodeBots - Robots powered by Java Script\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's right... If you have JavaScript experience, you can use your powers to control Hardware.\r\n\r\nNodeBots are any kind of Hardware powered by JavaScript and node.js. These **bots** can be LEDs, sensors, servos, drones, robot arms, thermostats or anything else you can imagine with hardware and electronics.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will guide through assembling and programming few projects using Arduino & node.js\r\n\r\nThe ultimate combination of Arduino, Johnny-Five, node.js & few other hardware lets you create amazing things. Come tinker with hardware and few lines of JavaScript code to make things light up.\r\n\r\n\r\nGet an Arduino Starter Kit, if you like to hack after the talk or use it for next month Dev Challenge; Suitable Kits can be found at [oomlout](http://oomlout.co.uk/collections/arduino/products/arduino-starter-kit-ardx) and [Proto-Pic](http://proto-pic.co.uk/proto-pic-arduino-starter-kit-for-arduino-uno/). These kits contain an Arduino, Breadboard, Selection of LEDs, Sensors, Motors, etc.,\r\n\r\n## Slide Deck\r\n[SlideDeck](http://slides.com/thiru/nodebots#/)\r\n\r\n- Node Bots - Title Deck\r\n- About Me\r\n  - Elephant Proto-Pic\r\n  - Web Developer - NTT data\r\n  - Client List - EE | Kiln | Unisys | McKesson\r\n- Before Proceeding\r\n  - Abstraction - img\r\n- In this talk\r\n  - Hardware Basics\r\n    - Breadboard\r\n    - electronics\r\n    - resistors\r\n      - color code reading - BBROYGBGW\r\n    - ardx Kit\r\n  - robot - general - noun\r\n    - dictionary Slide\r\n    - examples in single screen + gif\r\n  - node-js - Short parts\r\n    - async I/O\r\n    - non blocking\r\n    - npm - modules\r\n  - NodeBots\r\n    - nodejs + robots = NodeBots\r\n    - NodeBots synonym\r\n  - Why JS\r\n    - arduino native env in C\r\n    - quotes from NodeBots\r\n    - REPL or node blink.js\r\n  - Hardware\r\n    - Arduino\r\n    - Telsa\r\n    - RPi\r\n    - SparkFun\r\n    - Galellio\r\n  - How Did I Start\r\n    - Chiti robot\r\n    - Story on Outlook Messenger\r\n    - show java program - video/demo\r\n  - Installation Instructions\r\n    - nodejs\r\n    - Johnny-Five\r\n  - Arduino Intro\r\n    - What is?\r\n    - Which Board\r\n    - Board Choices\r\n  - Johnny-Five\r\n    - Why\r\n    - What\r\n    - Firmata\r\n  - demo\r\n    - Blink LED\r\n    - Motor (or) Servo\r\n    - Push Button\r\n    - SuperMan Rotating    \r\n  - Safety Instructions\r\n    - Turn off B4 Connection\r\n    - Dont get wet\r\n  - References\r\n    - Community - nodebots - nodecoptors\r\n    - Tutorials - node school\r\n    - Talks & Slides\r\n  - Thanks\r\n    - Your Turn\r\n  - Challenge ???\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Do:\r\n- Create Circuit Diagram for Demos\r\n- Emulator option\r\n- Slide Preparation\r\n- Basics of electronics\r\n- Working Demos & Live coding\r\n- servo & Sensors\r\n- Presentation hangout option from mobile\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
